"Futuristic 3D Developer Portfolio for Tushar Vaghela ‚Äì Full Stack Engineer"

üí° Prompt Description
Design and develop a high-tech, futuristic, dark-mode developer portfolio for Tushar Vaghela, a Full Stack Engineer with 2+ years of experience. The design must be clean, responsive, and interactive, showcasing advanced technical mastery across MERN Stack, Next.js, NestJS, React Native, Firebase, Supabase, Docker, AWS, and n8n.

üß† Visual & UX Design Requirements
Visual Theme: Neon Cyberpunk vibes with a sleek dark UI, animated neon-accented gradient lines, glassmorphism, and holographic panels for tech stacks.

Hero Section: Floating 3D hologram of Tushar inside a neon cube (using Three.js). Behind him, rotating floating tech logos (React, Node, MongoDB, NestJS, Docker).

Tech Stack Section: Interactive circular 3D orbit of tools built with Spline or Three.js‚Äîeach tech icon rotates and expands on hover with tooltips.

Featured Projects:

3D flip cards with neon borders and hover-to-rotate animation

Auto-playing muted video demos in modals on click

Dynamic holographic tags showing tech stack used

Skills Progression:

Animated radial bars or skill matrix heatmaps in neon blue/purple

Framer Motion driven transitions and micro-interactions

Admin Section: Firebase/Supabase-powered CMS with secure login and markdown-style editor for adding/updating projects

Mobile View: Vertical swipe experience like futuristic mobile OS, collapsible hologram cards

UI Animation: Use Framer Motion + GSAP for smooth transitions, card pop effects, and scroll-based interactions

üîß Technical Implementation Stack
Frontend: Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Three.js

3D UI: Use Spline, Three.js, or Rive for interactive objects

Backend/CMS: Firebase Firestore or Supabase with secure admin login

Media Handling: Videos auto-play via lightweight, lazy-loaded <video> tags with fallback thumbnails

Authentication: Google Sign-In using Firebase Auth

SEO Optimization: OpenGraph metadata, SSR for project modals

Performance: Static Generation (SSG), image/video lazy loading, CDN cache headers, and code-splitting
